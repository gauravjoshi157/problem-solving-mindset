# Task 1: Python Installation & Development Environment Setup

- **Objective:** Install Python and set up an IDE or code editor (Visual Studio Code, PyCharm, or a simple text editor).
- **Practice:** Try to run a simple "Hello, World!" program.

## Steps to Follow
1. **Install Python:** Download and install Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/).
2. **Install an IDE or Code Editor:** Choose and install an IDE or code editor such as Visual Studio Code, PyCharm, or a simple text editor.
3. **Set Up the IDE or Code Editor:** Configure the IDE or code editor to work with Python. This may include installing Python extensions or plugins.
4. **Verify Python Installation:** Open a terminal or command prompt and run `python --version` to ensure Python is installed correctly.
5. **Create a Python File:** Create a new Python file with the desired `name.py`. Python files contain `.py` extensions.
6. **Write a "Hello, World!" Program:** Write the following code in the file:

    ```python
    print("Hello, World!")
    ```

7. **Save and Run the Program:** Save the file and run the program using the IDE or command line.

## Example
To run the program from the command line, navigate to the directory containing the file and execute:

```sh
python name.py
```

- **Outcome**

- Install Python and set up an IDE or Visual Studio Code.
- Create Python files with a .py extension.
- Write and run a "Hello, World!" program.
- Verify the Python installation and IDE setup.
- Understand the basics of running Python programs from the command line.
